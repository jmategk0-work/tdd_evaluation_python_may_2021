Instructions:

Our team uses agile software development techniques such as 
Test Driven Development (TDD) with Paired Programming using the 
Red-Green-Refactor methodology. This means Developer A will first write
a test that fails (The Red State); at the same time Developer B will 
write code to make that test pass by any means necessary. Once 
developer Bâ€™s code passes (The Green state) developer A and 
developer B will then review and refactor the code and test to optimize 
efficiency, readability, and maintainability.

 You have been given code for a small software library that is in the 
 Red State. Your task is to implement the code within the corresponding
 method signatures so that all the tests pass (The Green State). 
 Once all your tests pass one of our software developers will review 
 your code and you will discuss how it could be refactored it together.
 Please ask if you have any questions about the code you have been given.
